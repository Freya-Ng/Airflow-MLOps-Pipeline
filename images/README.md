# Images Directory

This directory contains images and diagrams used in the project documentation.

## Files

- `ml_pipeline_dag.png` - Airflow DAG visualization showing the complete ML pipeline workflow with task dependencies and branching logic

## Adding Images

To add the pipeline visualization:
1. Take a screenshot of your DAG graph view from the Airflow UI
2. Save it as `ml_pipeline_dag.png` in this directory
3. The image is automatically referenced in the main README.md

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize images for web (reasonable file size)
- Use PNG for screenshots and diagrams
- Keep images up-to-date with code changes
